- 1. app/layout.tsx — Root Layout

This is the main wrapper for your entire website.

Anything you put here (like a header, footer, or global styles) will appear on every page of your website.

It’s like the outer frame holding all your pages inside.

Think of it like the main skeleton of your website.
